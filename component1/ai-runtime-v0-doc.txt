ProVit AI Runtime SDK (v0) — Documentation
Component

Evidence Event Standard → AI Runtime SDK

Version

v0.1 (Core Minimal Runtime Evidence Capture)

1. Overview

ProVit AI Runtime SDK is the first building block of the ProVit Decision Evidence Platform.

It enables organizations to capture AI recommendation evidence at runtime in a decision-scoped, audit-ready format — without disrupting model execution.

This SDK is designed to be:

lightweight

safe in production

non-blocking

integration-friendly

enterprise-neutral

2. Purpose

AI systems are increasingly influencing high-impact enterprise decisions.

However, enterprises often cannot answer:

Which model produced this recommendation?

What was the AI output?

How confident was the AI?

Can this decision be reconstructed later?

The AI Runtime SDK solves this by capturing the minimum evidence required to prove:

✅ AI involvement
✅ Recommendation output
✅ Model identity
✅ Decision reconstructability

3. Scope of v0

The AI Runtime SDK v0 captures only:

Model Identity Evidence

model name

model version

Recommendation Evidence

output label

confidence score

No additional features are included in v0.

This ensures:

minimal integration effort

zero runtime risk

scalable foundation

4. Design Principles
4.1 Minimal Evidence, Maximum Value

The SDK captures only the core facts required for governance:

who the model is

what it recommended

how confident it was

4.2 Decision-Scoped by Default

Every AI runtime event must belong to a business decision.

The SDK requires:

decision_id

This enables ProVit to reconstruct decision timelines later.

4.3 Non-Blocking and Safe

The SDK operates asynchronously.

It must never:

slow down inference

block execution

crash the AI system

If ProVit is unreachable, the AI continues normally.

5. What the SDK Captures
Evidence Fields (v0)
Evidence Category	Field
Decision Scope	decision_id
Model Identity	model_name, model_version
Recommendation Output	label, confidence_score
Timestamp	auto-generated
6. Event Type Emitted

The SDK emits only one event type:

ai.runtime

This represents:

“An AI model produced a recommendation for a decision at runtime.”

7. Event Structure
7.1 Canonical Runtime Event Format
{
  "event_type": "ai.runtime",
  "decision_id": "d-8829",
  "timestamp": "2026-02-15T10:30:00Z",
  "payload": {
    "model": {
      "name": "credit_risk_model",
      "version": "v1.0"
    },
    "recommendation": {
      "label": "approve",
      "confidence_score": 0.82
    }
  }
}

8. SDK Public API
8.1 Core Method

The SDK exposes one simple method:

ai_runtime(
    decision_id: str,
    model_name: str,
    model_version: str,
    label: str,
    confidence_score: float
)

8.2 Example Usage
from provit_sdk import ProVitClient

client = ProVitClient()

client.ai_runtime(
    decision_id="d-8829",
    model_name="credit_risk_model",
    model_version="v1.0",
    label="approve",
    confidence_score=0.82
)


This emits runtime evidence instantly.

9. Integration Requirements
Minimum Integration Effort

AI teams only need:

a decision identifier

model identity

recommendation output

Integration takes less than 5 minutes.

10. Runtime Safety Guarantees

The AI Runtime SDK follows strict safety rules:

10.1 Non-Blocking Execution

Events are emitted asynchronously.

Inference latency impact is near zero.

10.2 Fail-Safe Behavior

If the ProVit server is down or unreachable:

the SDK silently skips emission

AI model execution continues normally

The SDK must never raise runtime exceptions to the host system.

10.3 No Enforcement

The SDK does not:

block decisions

enforce policies

interrupt workflows

It only captures evidence.

11. Transport Layer (MVP)

The SDK sends events to ProVit via REST:

Endpoint
POST /v1/events

Authentication
Authorization: Bearer <API_KEY>

Timeout

max request timeout: 2 seconds

fire-and-forget mode

12. Expected Output in ProVit Platform

Once events are captured, ProVit can reconstruct:

AI recommendation evidence per decision

Model usage patterns

Confidence distribution

Missing evidence gaps

This becomes the foundation for:

decision reconstruction

human oversight tracking

audit evidence packs

automation creep detection

13. Definition of Done (AI Runtime SDK v0)

The SDK is complete when:

✅ AI runtime recommendation events can be emitted
✅ Model identity is captured
✅ Confidence score is stored
✅ Events are decision-scoped
✅ SDK never blocks or crashes AI execution
✅ Works across any AI model system

14. Future Extensions (Not in v0)

Later versions will add:

explanations

prompt + feature hashes

policy expectation hooks

retry buffers

multi-language SDKs

But v0 remains intentionally minimal.

✅ Summary

ProVit AI Runtime SDK v0 provides the first enterprise-grade primitive for AI governance:

“At runtime, capture what the AI recommended, under which model identity, for which decision — safely and non-intrusively.”

This is the foundation of ProVit’s Decision Evidence Platform.
